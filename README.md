# Fast-Classical-Scaling
A matlab implementation of the paper "Classical scaling revisited". An efficient non-linear dimensionality reduction by approximating the classical scaling method (also known as multidimensional scaling (MDS) or Isomap), using distance interpolation within the subspace of the Laplace Beltrami eigenfunctions.
